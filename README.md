This repo contains the code responsible for Quether: The Quick Weather App.

### Running Locally

You'll need a local `dev.sh`, or something to `source` for a `FORECAST` environment variable that will contain your [Dark Sky Forecast API Key](https://developer.forecast.io/).

`grunt dev` sets up a local development environment.

`npm start` sets up a production environment.
